        <wbr>nvestigators probing the blast near Delhi's iconic Red Fort have unearthed a chilling plan: the suspected terror module involving doctors allegedly linked to Jaish-e-Mohammad had planned blasts at six locations in the National Capital Region on December 6.

The date is significant: this was the day when the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was demolished in 1992. The suspected terrorists arrested in connection with the blast have said the date was chosen because they wanted to "avenge the Babri Masjid demolition".

According to top intelligence sources, the members of the suspected terror module have said during interrogation that they had prepared a phase-wise plan to carry out serial blasts in the National Capital Region. Officials have shared details of the five-phase plan:

Phase 1: Formation of the terror module linked with Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind
